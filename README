To compile, simply run make. This will produce clientSNFS and serverSNFS executables, and object files. The server is run with ./serverSNFS -port <port> -mount <mountpoint>. The client is run with ./clientSNFS <server> <port> <filename>.

You can also link against client.o to get the functions to interact with the server with.

To test, simply run the server, then the client. Put things into the test file to see if the results are sane.
